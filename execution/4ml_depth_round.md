### Foundational Understanding (High Likelihood)

**Q1: Explain the mathematical foundation of gradient descent and its variants.**

*Structure your answer:*
```
Gradient descent finds parameters Œ∏ that minimize objective function J(Œ∏):

1. Basic algorithm:
   Œ∏_{t+1} = Œ∏_t - Œ∑¬∑‚àáJ(Œ∏_t)
   
   where:
   - ‚àáJ(Œ∏_t) is gradient at current point
   - Œ∑ is learning rate

2. Analysis of convergence:
   - For convex, L-Lipschitz functions: ||‚àáJ(Œ∏)|| ‚â§ L||Œ∏ - Œ∏'||
   - With learning rate Œ∑ ‚â§ 1/L, converges at rate O(1/T)
   - For Œº-strongly convex functions, converges at O(e^(-Œºt))

3. Key variants with mathematical formulations:

   a) Batch GD: Œ∏_{t+1} = Œ∏_t - Œ∑¬∑‚àáJ(Œ∏_t)
      - Deterministic trajectory
      - Computational complexity O(n) per update
      
   b) SGD: Œ∏_{t+1} = Œ∏_t - Œ∑¬∑‚àáJ_i(Œ∏_t)
      - Stochastic approximation: E[‚àáJ_i(Œ∏_t)] = ‚àáJ(Œ∏_t)
      - Convergence rate O(1/‚àöT) for convex functions
      - Requires decreasing learning rate schedule: Œ∑_t ‚àù 1/‚àöt
      
   c) Mini-batch SGD: Œ∏_{t+1} = Œ∏_t - Œ∑¬∑(1/|B|)¬∑‚àë_{i‚ààB}‚àáJ_i(Œ∏_t)
      - Reduces gradient variance by factor of |B|
      - Enables vectorized computation
      
   d) Momentum: v_{t+1} = Œ≥¬∑v_t + Œ∑¬∑‚àáJ(Œ∏_t), Œ∏_{t+1} = Œ∏_t - v_{t+1}
      - Accelerates convergence in ravines
      - Theoretical speed-up for quadratic functions
      
   e) Nesterov Accelerated Gradient:
      v_{t+1} = Œ≥¬∑v_t + Œ∑¬∑‚àáJ(Œ∏_t - Œ≥¬∑v_t)
      Œ∏_{t+1} = Œ∏_t - v_{t+1}
      - Look-ahead gradient computation

      - Adam convergence properties: effectively combines momentum and RMSProp
```

**Q2: Derive backpropagation algorithm and explain potential issues.**

*Structure your answer:*
```
Backpropagation efficiently computes gradients in neural networks using chain rule:

1. Forward propagation:
   - For L-layer network with weights W^l, biases b^l
   - z^l = W^l¬∑a^{l-1} + b^l   (pre-activation)
   - a^l = œÉ(z^l)   (activation)
   - ≈∑ = a^L   (output)
   - J(W,b) = Loss(≈∑,y)   (objective)

2. Backward propagation derivation:
   - Define Œ¥^l = ‚àÇJ/‚àÇz^l   (error at layer l)
   - For output layer: Œ¥^L = ‚àÇJ/‚àÇa^L ¬∑ ‚àÇa^L/‚àÇz^L
   - Recursive computation: Œ¥^l = ((W^{l+1})^T ¬∑ Œ¥^{l+1}) ‚äô œÉ'(z^l)
   - Gradients: ‚àÇJ/‚àÇW^l = Œ¥^l ¬∑ (a^{l-1})^T
   - Gradients: ‚àÇJ/‚àÇb^l = Œ¥^l

3. Computational complexity:
   - Forward pass: O(Œ£_l n_l¬∑n_{l-1})
   - Backward pass: Same complexity as forward
   - Memory requirement: Store all intermediate activations

4. Potential issues:

   a) Vanishing gradients:
      - Occurs when ||‚àÇa^{l+1}/‚àÇa^l|| << 1 across many layers
      - Mathematical analysis: For sigmoid, œÉ'(z) ‚â§ 0.25
      - With L layers: ||‚àÇa^L/‚àÇa^1|| ‚â§ 0.25^L ‚Üí 0 as L increases
      - Solutions: ReLU activations, skip connections, batch normalization
   
   b) Exploding gradients:
      - Occurs when ||‚àÇa^{l+1}/‚àÇa^l|| >> 1 across layers
      - Cause: Weights with eigenvalues > 1
      - Solution: Gradient clipping, proper initialization
   
   c) Second-order effects:
      - Hessian computation prohibitive: O(n¬≤ √ó L) space
      - Approximations: Diagonal, Kronecker-factored, low-rank
   
   d) Computational optimizations:
      - Activation checkpointing to trade computation for memory
      - Mixed precision to reduce memory footprint
```

**Q3: Explain the mathematics behind attention mechanisms in transformers.**

*Structure your answer:*
```
Attention mechanisms compute weighted sums of values based on query-key similarities:

1. Self-attention formulation:
   - Inputs: Sequence X ‚àà ‚Ñù^(n√ód) with n tokens of dimension d
   - Projections: Q = XW_Q, K = XW_K, V = XW_V where W_* ‚àà ‚Ñù^(d√ód_k)
   - Attention function: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k)V
   
2. Mathematical interpretation:
   - softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k) gives attention weights A ‚àà ‚Ñù^(n√ón)
   - A_{ij} represents influence of token j on token i
   - Output is weighted sum of value vectors
   - ‚àöd_k scaling prevents excessive peakiness of softmax for large d_k
   
3. Multi-head attention extends this:
   - Perform h parallel attention operations
   - For head i: head_i = Attention(XW_Q^i, XW_K^i, XW_V^i)
   - Concatenate and project: MultiHead(X) = Concat(head_1,...,head_h)W_O
   - Each head can attend to different patterns
   
4. Analysis of computational properties:
   - Time complexity: O(n¬≤d) for sequence length n
   - Memory complexity: O(n¬≤) for attention weights
   - Gradient flow: Direct paths between any tokens
   
5. Mathematical benefits:
   - Context-dependent representations: Unlike fixed embeddings
   - Permutation equivariance: f(œÄ(X)) = œÄ(f(X)) for permutation œÄ
   - Long-range dependency modeling: No distance penalty
   
6. Limitations and extensions:
   - Quadratic complexity: Addressed by sparse attention variants
   - Positional information: Requires explicit position encodings
   - Linear self-attention: Q(K^TV) vs (QK^T)V reduces complexity to O(nd¬≤)

   - REINFORCE: ‚àá_Œ∏ J(Œ∏) = ùîº_œÄ[Œ£_t ‚àá_Œ∏ log œÄ_Œ∏(a_t|s_t)¬∑G_t]
   - Advantage Actor-Critic: ‚àá_Œ∏ J(Œ∏) = ùîº_œÄ[‚àá_Œ∏ log œÄ_Œ∏(a_t|s_t)¬∑A(s_t,a_t)]
   - PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization): Constrains policy updates
