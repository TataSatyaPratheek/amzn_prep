## Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession
**Definition:** Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**Example Question:** Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a customer.

**Sample Answer Structure:**
```
Situation: As a machine learning engineer at a semiconductor manufacturing company, we received urgent feedback that our wafer defect detection model was classifying novel defects incorrectly.

Task: I needed to quickly investigate and resolve this issue as it was causing our customer to miss critical defects, potentially resulting in $200K daily losses.

Action: 
1. Immediately analyzed misclassified examples, identifying a domain shift in the new production line
2. Developed an online adaptation technique using transfer learning to quickly fine-tune on limited new samples
3. Prioritized high-impact defect types based on customer feedback
4. Implemented a fast-feedback loop with confidence thresholds that escalated uncertain predictions for manual review
5. Worked overtime for three days to implement and deploy the solution

Result: 
1. Reduced false negative rate from 17% to 3% within 48 hours
2. Implemented continuous learning pipeline, reducing future adaptation time by 85%
3. Customer publicly praised our responsiveness at industry conference
4. Methodology became standard procedure for all new production lines
```

### 2. Ownership
**Definition:** Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

**Example Question:** Describe a time when you saw a problem and took the initiative to fix it rather than waiting for someone else.

**Sample Answer Structure:**
```
Situation: During a model deployment project, I noticed our team had no standardized way to monitor model drift, resulting in performance degradation going undetected.

Task: While not explicitly my responsibility, I recognized the need to establish automated model monitoring for production ML systems.

1. Researched best practices for statistical testing of distribution shifts
2. Developed prototype monitoring system using statistical tests (KS-test, KL-divergence)
3. Presented benefits to leadership with quantifiable metrics
4. Volunteered to lead implementation across three product teams
5. Created documentation and trained colleagues on usage

Result:
1. Detected concept drift in two production models before customer impact
2. Reduced average debugging time for model issues by 67%
3. System adopted company-wide as standard practice
4. Eventually promoted to lead ML Infrastructure team based on this initiative
```

### 3. Invent and Simplify
**Definition:** Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here."

**Example Question:** Tell me about a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem.

**Sample Answer Structure:**
```

3. Improved convergence time by 37% despite recomputation overhead
4. Approach adopted by three other research teams
5. Published internal technical report documenting methodology
```

### 4. Are Right, A Lot
**Definition:** Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**Example Question:** Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult decision with limited information.

**Sample Answer Structure:**
```
Situation: Leading a project to develop a new recommender system algorithm with tight deadline, I had to decide between using a proven but limited collaborative filtering approach or a promising but unproven deep learning method.

2. Hybrid approach leveraging strengths of both methods emerged
3. Final system improved recommendation CTR by 23%
4. Decision framework adopted for future algorithm selection
5. Project delivered on time with performance exceeding targets
```

### 5. Learn and Be Curious
**Definition:** Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**Example Question:** Describe a time when you sought out a new technology or methodology to solve a problem.

**Sample Answer Structure:**
```
Situation: Our team was using TensorFlow for all ML development, but I observed increasing challenges with deployment flexibility and research productivity.
