- **Relate to your projects**: "I implemented this in my work on..."
- **Technical precision**: Use proper mathematical notation
- **Address edge cases**: Show you think beyond the happy path

#### System Design Round
- **Follow the framework**: Problem definition → data → models → deployment → monitoring
- **Quantify where possible**: "We'd need about 10TB storage for this data"
- **Draw clear system diagrams**: Boxes and arrows for components and data flow
- **Justify your decisions**: "I chose this approach because..."
- **Acknowledge constraints**: Time, money, complexity trade-offs

#### Coding Round
- **Restate the problem**: Confirm understanding before coding
- **Design before coding**: Explain your approach first
- **Write clean, readable code**: Good variable names, proper spacing
- **Test thoroughly**: Consider edge cases, validate with examples
- **Analyze time/space complexity**: "This solution is O(n log n) because..."

#### Behavioral Round
- **Use STAR format consistently**: Situation → Task → Action → Result
- **Quantify impact**: "This resulted in 20% improvement in..."
- **Connect to Leadership Principles**: "This demonstrates Customer Obsession because..."
- **Be authentic**: Honest self-reflection is more compelling than perfection
- **Listen carefully**: Answer the question asked, not what you prepared

### Communication Strategies

#### Technical Communication
- **Layer complexity**: Start simple, add details progressively
- **Use proper terminology**: Show you speak the ML language fluently
- **Bridge academic to practical**: Connect theory to business outcomes
- **Appropriate level of detail**: Match depth to interviewer's expertise
- **Analogies for complex concepts**: "This is similar to..." for clarity

#### Non-Technical Communication
- **Confident body language**: Sit up straight, make eye contact
- **Manage speaking pace**: Slow down when explaining complex topics
- **Ask for feedback**: "Did that answer your question?"
- **Positive framing**: "The challenge was... and here's how I solved it"
- **Active listening**: Nod, take notes, reference interviewer's points

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Technical Pitfalls
- **Overcomplicating solutions**: Start simple, then enhance
- **Coding without planning**: Take time to think before writing
- **Neglecting practical constraints**: Consider scale, cost, time
- **Missing edge cases**: Consider empty inputs, large numbers, etc.
- **Assuming too much knowledge**: Define terms and concepts as needed

#### Behavioral Pitfalls
- **Generic examples**: Be specific about your role and actions
- **Excessive team focus**: Use "I" instead of "we" for your contributions
- **Lack of structure**: Rambling without clear STAR format
- **Negativity about past roles**: Keep criticism constructive
- **Memorized responses**: Sound natural, not rehearsed

### Handle Difficult Situations

#### If You Don't Know Something
- **Be honest**: "I'm not familiar with that specific algorithm"
- **Bridge to what you know**: "It sounds similar to X, which I know works by..."
- **Show learning approach**: "Here's how I'd go about understanding it..."
- **Ask for clarification**: "Could you share more context about that?"
- **Demonstrate problem-solving**: "Let me think through this logically..."

#### If You Get Stuck Coding

- **Reframe the question**: "To make sure I understand..."
- **Connect to a similar experience**: "While I haven't had that exact situation..."
- **Be honest but constructive**: "That's an interesting question. I haven't encountered that specific scenario, but here's how I would approach it..."
- **Circle back later**: "Could we return to this question? I'd like more time to recall a good example"
