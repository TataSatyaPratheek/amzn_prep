# L4 Applied Scientist Interview Flashcards

## ML Fundamentals

### Card 1: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
**Front:** Define the bias-variance tradeoff and provide its mathematical decomposition.
**Back:**
```
Expected test error can be decomposed as:
E[(y - ŷ)²] = (Bias[ŷ])² + Var[ŷ] + σ²

Where:
- Bias[ŷ] = E[ŷ] - y (systematic error)
- Var[ŷ] = E[(ŷ - E[ŷ])²] (estimation variance)
- σ² is irreducible error

As model complexity increases:
- Bias decreases (better fit to training data)
- Variance increases (more sensitivity to training samples)
```

### Card 2: Gradient Descent Variants
**Front:** Compare SGD, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam optimization algorithms.
**Back:**
```
1. SGD: θ ← θ - η∇L_i(θ)
   - High variance, computationally efficient
   
2. Momentum: 
   v ← γv + η∇L(θ)
   θ ← θ - v
   - Accelerates convergence in consistent directions
   - Dampens oscillations in ravines
   
3. RMSProp:
   E[g²] ← β·E[g²] + (1-β)·(∇L(θ))²
   θ ← θ - η·∇L(θ)/√(E[g²] + ε)
   - Adapts learning rates per-parameter
   
4. Adam:
   m ← β₁m + (1-β₁)·∇L(θ)   [first moment]
   v ← β₂v + (1-β₂)·(∇L(θ))² [second moment]
   θ ← θ - η·m̂/√(v̂ + ε)  [with bias correction]
   - Combines momentum and RMSProp
   - Default choice for many applications
```

### Card 3: Regularization Techniques
**Front:** Explain L1 vs L2 regularization effects mathematically.
**Back:**
```
L1 regularization adds λ||w||₁ = λΣ|w_i| to loss function.
L2 regularization adds λ||w||₂² = λΣw_i² to loss function.

L1 gradient contribution: ∂/∂w_i = ... + λ·sign(w_i)
L2 gradient contribution: ∂/∂w_i = ... + 2λw_i

Key difference: 
- L1 applies constant penalty regardless of weight magnitude
- Promotes sparsity by pushing weights exactly to zero
- Equivalent to MAP with Laplace prior: p(w) ∝ exp(-λ||w||₁)

- L2 applies penalty proportional to weight magnitude
- Weights shrink but rarely become exactly zero
- Equivalent to MAP with Gaussian prior: p(w) ∝ exp(-λ||w||₂²)
```

### Card 4: Evaluation Metrics
**Front:** When should you use precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC?
**Back:**
```
1. Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
   - Use when false positives are costly
   - E.g., Spam detection, fraud alerts

2. Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
   - Use when false negatives are costly
   - E.g., Disease detection, safety critical systems

3. F1-Score = 2·(precision·recall)/(precision+recall)
   - Use when balance between precision/recall needed
   - E.g., Information retrieval, document classification

4. AUC-ROC = P(score(positive) > score(negative))
   - Use when ranking performance matters
   - Threshold-invariant metric
   - E.g., Recommendation systems, risk scoring

For imbalanced data: 
- Precision-recall curve > ROC curve
- Macro vs micro averaging depends on class importance
```

### Card 5: Cross-Validation
**Front:** Explain different cross-validation strategies and their use cases.
**Back:**
```
1. k-Fold Cross Validation:
   - Split data into k folds, train on k-1, test on remaining
   - Use for general-purpose evaluation
   - k=5,10 balances bias-variance in estimate

2. Stratified k-Fold:
   - Maintains class distribution in each fold
   - Use for imbalanced classification problems

3. Leave-One-Out CV:
   - Special case where k=n (sample size)
   - Use for very small datasets
   - High computational cost, high variance

4. Time Series CV (expanding window):
   - Train: [0,t), Test: [t,t+w) with increasing t
   - Use for time series forecasting, sequential data
   - Prevents data leakage from future observations

5. Group k-Fold:
   - Ensures groups don't span train/test
   - Use when data has group structure or dependencies
   - E.g., Multiple samples per patient
```

## Machine Learning Algorithms

### Card 6: Linear Regression Derivation
**Front:** Derive the closed-form solution for ordinary least squares.
**Back:**
```
For data {(x_i, y_i)}_{i=1}^n where x_i ∈ ℝᵈ, y_i ∈ ℝ:

Objective: minimize J(w) = ||y - Xw||² = (y - Xw)ᵀ(y - Xw)
         = yᵀy - 2wᵀXᵀy + wᵀXᵀXw

Taking gradient: ∇ₘJ(w) = -2Xᵀy + 2XᵀXw

Setting to zero: XᵀXw = Xᵀy

Solution: w* = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy

For ridge regression (L2):
w* = (XᵀX + λI)⁻¹Xᵀy
```

### Card 7: Logistic Regression
**Front:** Derive the gradient for logistic regression using maximum likelihood.
**Back:**
```
Model: P(y=1|x) = σ(wᵀx) = 1/(1+e^(-wᵀx))

Log-likelihood:
ℓ(w) = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ[yᵢlog(σ(wᵀxᵢ)) + (1-yᵢ)log(1-σ(wᵀxᵢ))]

Using σ'(z) = σ(z)(1-σ(z)), the gradient is:
∇ₘℓ(w) = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿxᵢ(yᵢ - σ(wᵀxᵢ))

Gradient descent update:
w ← w + η∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿxᵢ(yᵢ - σ(wᵀxᵢ))

Decision boundary is linear: wᵀx = 0
```

### Card 8: Support Vector Machines
**Front:** Explain the dual formulation of SVMs and the kernel trick.
**Back:**
```
Primal problem:
min_{w,b} 1/2||w||² s.t. yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1 for all i

Dual formulation:
max_α ∑ᵢαᵢ - 1/2∑ᵢ∑ⱼαᵢαⱼyᵢyⱼxᵢᵀxⱼ
s.t. αᵢ ≥ 0 and ∑ᵢαᵢyᵢ = 0

Decision function: f(x) = sign(∑ᵢαᵢyᵢ(xᵢᵀx) + b)

Kernel trick:
- Replace dot products xᵢᵀxⱼ with kernel K(xᵢ,xⱼ)
- Implicitly maps data to higher-dimensional space
- Decision function: f(x) = sign(∑ᵢαᵢyᵢK(xᵢ,x) + b)

Popular kernels:
- Linear: K(x,z) = xᵀz
- Polynomial: K(x,z) = (xᵀz + c)ᵈ
- RBF: K(x,z) = exp(-γ||x-z||²)
```

### Card 9: Decision Trees
**Front:** How are splits determined in decision trees? Compare information gain, gain ratio, and Gini index.
**Back:**
```
Information Gain:
IG(S,A) = H(S) - ∑ᵥ(|Sᵥ|/|S|)H(Sᵥ)
where H(S) = -∑ₚP(c)log₂P(c) is the entropy

Gain Ratio:
GR(S,A) = IG(S,A)/H_A(S)
where H_A(S) = -∑ᵥ(|Sᵥ|/|S|)log₂(|Sᵥ|/|S|)
- Addresses bias toward attributes with many values

Gini Index:
Gini(S) = 1 - ∑ₖP(c)²
- Measures probability of misclassification
- Used in CART algorithm
- Computationally simpler than entropy

Comparison:
- Information gain tends to prefer attributes with many values
- Gain ratio normalizes for attribute cardinality
- Gini and entropy often yield similar trees
- Gini favors larger partitions, entropy more balanced
```

### Card 10: Random Forests
**Front:** Explain how Random Forests work and why they improve over single decision trees.
**Back:**
```
Algorithm:
1. Bootstrap sample of training data for each tree
2. Grow each tree with a random subset of features at each split
3. Aggregate predictions by majority vote (classification) or averaging (regression)

Key innovations:
- Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) reduces variance
- Random feature subset decorrelates trees
- Out-of-bag (OOB) samples provide validation estimate

Advantages over single trees:
- Lower variance without increasing bias
- Better generalization and robustness
- Built-in feature importance via permutation
- Reduced overfitting
- Handles high-dimensional data well

Parameters to tune:
- Number of trees (more is better but diminishing returns)
- Max features per split (√p for classification, p/3 for regression)
- Min samples per leaf (controls leaf purity)
```

### Card 11: Gradient Boosting
**Front:** Explain the gradient boosting algorithm and contrast with AdaBoost.
**Back:**
```
Gradient Boosting Algorithm:
1. Initialize model: F₀(x) = argmin_γ ∑ᵢL(yᵢ,γ)
2. For m = 1 to M:
   a. Compute pseudo-residuals: rᵢₘ = -[∂L(yᵢ,F(xᵢ))/∂F(xᵢ)]_{F=Fₘ₋₁}
   b. Fit base learner hₘ to pseudo-residuals
   c. Compute step size: γₘ = argmin_γ ∑ᵢL(yᵢ,Fₘ₋₁(xᵢ)+γhₘ(xᵢ))
   d. Update model: Fₘ(x) = Fₘ₋₁(x) + η·γₘhₘ(x)

Key properties:
- Sequentially fits new models to negative gradient of loss
- Learning rate η controls regularization
- Can use any differentiable loss function
- XGBoost adds regularization term to objective

AdaBoost vs Gradient Boosting:
- AdaBoost reweights misclassified examples
- Gradient Boosting fits to residuals
- AdaBoost uses exponential loss specifically
- Gradient Boosting works with any differentiable loss
- Both are forward stagewise additive models
```

### Card 12: Neural Networks
**Front:** Explain backpropagation algorithm with mathematical derivation.
**Back:**
```
Forward propagation:
z^(l) = W^(l)a^(l-1) + b^(l)
a^(l) = σ(z^(l))

For MSE loss L = (1/2)||y-a^(L)||²:

1. Define error signal: δ^(l) = ∂L/∂z^(l)

2. Output layer error:
   δ^(L) = -(y-a^(L))⊙σ'(z^(L))

3. Backpropagate error:
   δ^(l) = ((W^(l+1))ᵀδ^(l+1))⊙σ'(z^(l))

4. Compute gradients:
   ∂L/∂W^(l) = δ^(l)(a^(l-1))ᵀ
   ∂L/∂b^(l) = δ^(l)

5. Update parameters:
   W^(l) ← W^(l) - η·∂L/∂W^(l)
   b^(l) ← b^(l) - η·∂L/∂b^(l)

Key insight: Chain rule allows computing gradients efficiently by reusing intermediate results.
```

### Card 13: Attention Mechanisms
**Front:** Explain self-attention computation in transformer models.
**Back:**
```
Self-attention computation:

1. Linear projections:
   Q = XW_Q  (queries)
   K = XW_K  (keys)
   V = XW_V  (values)

2. Compute attention scores:
   A = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)

3. Output is weighted sum of values:
   Z = AV

Matrix form: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V

Multihead attention:
- Split representation into h heads
- Perform attention independently for each head
- Concatenate and linearly project results
- Allows attending to different positions/aspects

Key benefits:
- O(1) path length between any tokens vs O(n) in RNNs
- Parallelizable computation
- Better long-range dependency modeling
```

### Card 14: Maximum Likelihood Estimation
**Front:** Derive the MLE for Gaussian distribution parameters.
**Back:**
```
For samples X = {x₁,...,xₙ} from N(μ,σ²):

Likelihood function:
L(μ,σ²|X) = ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(1/√(2πσ²))·exp(-(xᵢ-μ)²/(2σ²))

Log-likelihood:
ℓ(μ,σ²|X) = -n/2·log(2π) - n/2·log(σ²) - ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(xᵢ-μ)²/(2σ²)

Set partial derivatives to zero:
∂ℓ/∂μ = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(xᵢ-μ)/σ² = 0
∂ℓ/∂σ² = -n/(2σ²) + ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(xᵢ-μ)²/(2σ⁴) = 0

Solutions:
μ_MLE = (1/n)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿxᵢ = x̄
σ²_MLE = (1/n)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(xᵢ-μ_MLE)²
```

### Card 15: Hypothesis Testing
**Front:** Explain Type I and Type II errors, p-values, and statistical power.
**Back:**
```
Type I error (false positive):
- Rejecting null hypothesis H₀ when it's true
- Probability = α (significance level)

Type II error (false negative):
- Failing to reject H₀ when it's false
- Probability = β

Statistical power:
- Probability of correctly rejecting false H₀
- Power = 1 - β
- Depends on effect size, sample size, α

p-value:
- Probability of observing test statistic as extreme as actual result, assuming H₀ is true
- Reject H₀ if p-value < α
- NOT the probability that H₀ is true

Trade-off:
- Decreasing α reduces Type I error but increases Type II error
- Increasing sample size reduces both error types
```

### Card 16: Common Probability Distributions

   - Mean: μ, Variance: σ²
   - Sum of normals is normal
   - CLT: Sum of many independent variables → normal

2. Binomial(n,p):
   - PMF: P(X=k) = (n choose k)·p^k·(1-p)^(n-k)
   - Mean: np, Variance: np(1-p)

   - Normal approximation when np and n(1-p) > 5

3. Poisson(λ):
   - PMF: P(X=k) = e^(-λ)·λ^k/k!
   - Mean: λ, Variance: λ
   - Sum of Poissons is Poisson
   - Approximates binomial when n large, p small

4. Exponential(λ):
   - PDF: f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0
   - Mean: 1/λ, Variance: 1/λ²
   - Memoryless property: P(X>s+t|X>s) = P(X>t)
   - Models time between Poisson events
```

### Card 17: Central Limit Theorem
**Front:** State the Central Limit Theorem and explain its implications.
**Back:**
```
Central Limit Theorem:
If X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are i.i.d. with mean μ and variance σ² < ∞, then as n→∞:

(∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿXᵢ - nμ)/(σ√n) → N(0,1) in distribution

Or equivalently:
(X̄ - μ)/(σ/√n) → N(0,1)

Key implications:
- Sample mean distribution approaches normal regardless of original distribution
- Convergence rate depends on original distribution
- Enables statistical inference via z-tests and t-tests
- Justifies many statistical procedures on large samples
- In practice, often good approximation for n ≥ 30
```

- Maximum entropy for uniform distribution
- H(X) ≥ 0 with equality iff X is deterministic

KL Divergence:
D_KL(P||Q) = ∑ₓP(x)log(P(x)/Q(x)) = E_P[log(P(X)/Q(X))]
- Measures how different Q is from P
- D_KL(P||Q) ≥ 0 with equality iff P = Q
- Not symmetric: D_KL(P||Q) ≠ D_KL(Q||P)

Mutual Information:
I(X;Y) = ∑ₓ∑ᵧP(x,y)log(P(x,y)/(P(x)P(y)))
- I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)
- I(X;Y) ≥ 0 with equality iff X and Y are independent
- I(X;Y) = I(Y;X) (symmetric)
