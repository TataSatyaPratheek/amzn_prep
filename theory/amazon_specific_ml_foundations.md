# Applied ML Foundations for L4 Interviews (Improved)

This document covers foundational Machine Learning concepts relevant for an Amazon L4 Applied Scientist interview, focusing on practical understanding, trade-offs, and application rather than deep theoretical derivations.

## 1. Core Concepts & ML Workflow for Amazon Problems

### 1.1. ML Problem Framing (The Amazon Way)
- **Working Backwards:** Start with customer/business impact, not technology:
  - What specific problem needs solving?
  - What measurable impact would a solution deliver?
  - What KPI improvements can be reliably measured?

- **Translate Problems to ML Tasks:**
  
  | Business Problem | ML Task | Common Amazon Application |
  |------------------|---------|---------------------------|
  | Product categorization | Multi-class classification | Auto-assigning products to catalog hierarchy |
  | Customer churn prediction | Binary classification | Prime membership retention |
  | Demand forecasting | Time series forecasting | Inventory management |
  | Product recommendation | Ranking/recommendation | "Customers also bought" |
  | Warehouse anomaly detection | Unsupervised/semi-supervised | Predictive maintenance |
  | Voice command understanding | NLP/sequence classification | Alexa skill invocation |
  | Delivery time estimation | Regression | Promise date calculation |
  | Customer segmentation | Clustering | Targeted marketing |
  | Search relevance | Learning to rank | Product search results |

- **Define Success Metrics:** Both technical and business:
  - Technical metrics: AUC-ROC, RMSE, MAP@K, recall
  - Business metrics: Revenue lift, cost reduction, customer satisfaction
  - Amazon principle: Focus on metrics that directly drive customer or operational value

- **Consider Constraints:**
  - Cost-effectiveness (AWS resource utilization)
  - Latency requirements (real-time vs. batch)
  - Interpretability needs (automated vs. human-in-loop)
  - Scale requirements (millions of products/customers)
  - Data privacy and security requirements

- **Amazon Case Example: Product Demand Forecasting**
  - Business need: Optimize inventory levels to reduce costs while maintaining availability
  - ML formulation: Time-series forecasting at SKU level with prediction intervals
  - Success metrics: MAPE (technical), inventory carrying cost & stockout reduction (business)
  - Constraints: Daily forecasts for millions of SKUs, handle seasonality and special events

### 1.2. Data Understanding & Preparation

#### 1.2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Key Questions:**
  - What's the data shape, volume, and quality?
  - Are there missing values, outliers, or imbalanced classes?
  - What are the distributions and relationships between features?
  - Is there temporal structure, seasonality, or trends?

- **EDA Techniques:**
  - Distribution analysis: histograms, boxplots, density plots
  - Correlation analysis: correlation matrices, scatter plots
  - Time series analysis: trend, seasonality, autocorrelation
  - Dimensionality reduction for visualization: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP

- **Amazon-Specific Data Considerations:**
  - Massive scale (TB/PB of data)
  - Multi-modal data (text, images, time series, user behavior)
  - Regional variations and country-specific patterns
  - Seasonality (daily, weekly, Prime Day, holiday)
  - Sample code for EDA with AWS:

```python
# Sample code for distributed EDA using AWS Glue
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from pyspark.context import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session

# Load data from S3
df = spark.read.parquet("s3://bucket/path/to/data/")

# Basic statistics and profiling
summary_stats = df.describe().toPandas()

# Check missing values
missing_counts = df.select([F.count(F.when(F.col(c).isNull(), c)).alias(c) for c in df.columns]).toPandas()

# Check cardinality of categorical features
categorical_cols = ["category", "brand", "marketplace"]
for col in categorical_cols:
    print(f"Column {col} has {df.select(col).distinct().count()} unique values")

# Time series visualization (with data sample for visualization)
time_data = df.select("timestamp", "sales").orderBy("timestamp").limit(10000).toPandas()
plt.plot(time_data["timestamp"], time_data["sales"])
plt.title("Sales over time")
plt.savefig("time_series.png")
```

#### 1.2.2 Feature Engineering
- **Feature Types and Transformations:**
  - **Numerical Features:**
    - Scaling: StandardScaler (Z-score), MinMaxScaler (0-1 range), RobustScaler (outlier-resistant)
    - Transformations: Log transform (for skewed data), Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson
    - Binning: Equal-width, equal-frequency, domain-specific thresholds
    - Interactions: Products, ratios, differences between related features
  
  - **Categorical Features:**
    - Encoding methods trade-offs:

    | Method | Pros | Cons | Best For |
    |--------|------|------|----------|
    | One-Hot | Simple, no assumptions | High dimensionality for high-cardinality | Low-cardinality features |
    | Label | Low dimensionality | Introduces ordinal relationship | Tree models only |
    | Target | Handles high cardinality | Risk of overfitting, data leakage | High-cardinality with signal |
    | Hash | Fixed dimensions for high cardinality | Collision risk | Very high cardinality |
    | Embedding | Captures semantic relationships | Requires deep learning | Text, high-cardinality |
  
  - **Text Features:**
    - Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF for traditional models
    - Word/sentence embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT) for deep learning
    - Example: Product title/description processing for categorization
  
  - **Temporal Features:**
    - Timestamps to cyclical features (hour of day, day of week, month, quarter)
    - Lag features (value at t-1, t-7, etc.)
    - Rolling statistics (7-day average, 30-day standard deviation)
    - Time since event (days since last purchase)
  
  - **Geospatial Features:**
    - Distance calculations (e.g., customer to nearest fulfillment center)
    - Clustering of locations
    - Region/territory encoding

- **Feature Selection Methods:**
  - **Filter Methods:** Statistical tests (chi-square, ANOVA, correlation)
  - **Wrapper Methods:** Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
  - **Embedded Methods:** L1 regularization (Lasso), tree-based importance
  - **Automated Selection:** Genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization

- **Feature Store for Reusability (AWS):**
  - SageMaker Feature Store for feature sharing and reuse
  - Feature versioning and lineage
  - Online/offline feature consistency

- **Amazon Case Example: Product Classification**
  ```python
  # Feature engineering for product classification
  def engineer_product_features(product_df):
      # Text features - TF-IDF on product title
      tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, stop_words='english')
      title_features = tfidf.fit_transform(product_df['title'])
      
      # Categorical features - encode brand with target encoding
      brand_encoder = TargetEncoder()
      brand_features = brand_encoder.fit_transform(
          product_df['brand'], product_df['category'])
      
      # Numerical features - standardize price and normalize by category
      price_features = product_df.groupby('category')['price'].transform(
          lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std())
      
      # Image features - pretrained CNN embeddings (simplified)
      image_features = extract_image_embeddings(product_df['image_url'])
      
      # Combine all features
      return np.hstack([
          title_features.toarray(),
          brand_features.reshape(-1, 1),
          price_features.values.reshape(-1, 1),
          image_features
      ])
  ```

#### 1.2.3 Data Quality and Validation
- **Common Issues:**
  - Missing values: imputation strategies vs. dropping
  - Outliers: detection and treatment
  - Imbalanced data: resampling, weighted loss functions
  - Inconsistent formats: standardization
  - Duplicates: deduplication strategies

- **Data Validation Framework:**
  - Schema validation: column types, allowed values
  - Statistical validation: distribution checks, drift detection
  - Cross-field validation: business rule checks
  - Using AWS Glue DataBrew or Great Expectations

- **Amazon Case Study: Handling Missing Values in Inventory Data**
  - Context: Forecasting with incomplete inventory records
  - Strategy: Multi-tiered approach
    1. Forward-fill for temporary gaps (assume last known state)
    2. Regression-based imputation for predictable missing values
    3. Feature flagging for data quality (add "is_imputed" feature)
    4. Model-specific handling (XGBoost's native missing value support)
  - Validation: Compare imputation quality across methods using known data

#### 1.3.2 Training Methodology
- **Data Splitting Strategies:**
  - Random splitting (for i.i.d. data)
  - Temporal splitting (for time series data)
  - Entity-based splitting (user/product consistent)
  - Stratified splitting (preserve class distribution)

```python
# Example of temporal split for Amazon time series
def temporal_split(df, timestamp_col, training_cutoff, validation_cutoff):
    """Split data temporally for proper time series validation"""
    train = df[df[timestamp_col] < training_cutoff]
    val = df[(df[timestamp_col] >= training_cutoff) & (df[timestamp_col] < validation_cutoff)]
    test = df[df[timestamp_col] >= validation_cutoff]
    return train, val, test

# Usage (with AWS Glue)
train_data, val_data, test_data = temporal_split(
    df, 
    'event_date', 
    '2023-01-01', 
    '2023-02-01'
)

# Save to S3 for SageMaker use
train_data.write.parquet("s3://bucket/train/")
val_data.write.parquet("s3://bucket/validation/")
test_data.write.parquet("s3://bucket/test/")
```

- **Cross-Validation Approaches:**

  - TimeSeriesSplit (for temporal data)
  - Group K-Fold (when observations are grouped)

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Manual vs. automated approaches
  - Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization
  - Using SageMaker Hyperparameter Optimization
  - Cost-aware tuning (performance vs. resource usage)

```python
# SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning example
from sagemaker.tuner import HyperparameterTuner, ContinuousParameter, CategoricalParameter

xgb = sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(...)

hyperparameter_ranges = {
    'eta': ContinuousParameter(0.01, 0.3),
    'max_depth': CategoricalParameter([3, 5, 7, 9]),
    'min_child_weight': ContinuousParameter(1, 10),
    'subsample': ContinuousParameter(0.5, 1.0),
    'objective': CategoricalParameter(['binary:logistic', 'reg:squarederror']),
}

# Define an objective metric for tuning
objective_metric_name = 'validation:auc'
objective_type = 'Maximize'

tuner = HyperparameterTuner(
    xgb,
    objective_metric_name,
    hyperparameter_ranges,
    objective_type,
    max_jobs=20,
    max_parallel_jobs=4
)

tuner.fit({'train': train_data_uri, 'validation': validation_data_uri})
```
