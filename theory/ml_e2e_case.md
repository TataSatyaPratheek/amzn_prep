# Amazon ML Case Study: End-to-End Solution

## Case Study: Anomaly Detection for Amazon Fulfillment Centers

This comprehensive case study demonstrates how to approach a complex ML system design problem from beginning to end, specifically for an Amazon L4 Applied Scientist interview.

### Problem Statement

Amazon operates hundreds of fulfillment centers worldwide, processing millions of orders daily. Each fulfillment center contains complex machinery such as conveyor systems, sorting equipment, and robotic picking systems. Equipment failures cause significant operational disruptions, leading to delayed shipments and increased costs.

Your task is to design an end-to-end anomaly detection system that can:
1. Identify potential equipment failures before they occur
2. Prioritize maintenance activities to minimize disruption
3. Scale across hundreds of fulfillment centers globally
4. Improve over time as more data is collected

### 1. Problem Analysis & Framing

**Business Impact Assessment:**
- Each hour of downtime costs approximately $50,000-100,000 per fulfillment center
- Scheduled maintenance is 70% less costly than emergency repairs
- Current reactive approach leads to 3-4 major disruptions monthly per facility
- Maintenance teams are limited resources that need efficient allocation

**ML Problem Formulation:**
- Primary task: Multi-variate time series anomaly detection
- Secondary task: Anomaly severity classification and remaining useful life prediction
- Input data: Sensor readings, operational metrics, maintenance logs
- Output: Anomaly scores, failure probability, recommended maintenance timing

**Key Constraints:**
- Low false positive tolerance (maintenance is costly but less than failures)
- Real-time or near-real-time detection requirements (minutes, not hours)
- Heterogeneous equipment across facilities (different manufacturers, ages, configurations)
- Limited labeled failure data, but abundant normal operation data
- Edge computing capabilities at some locations, cloud connectivity at all

### 2. Data Strategy

**Data Sources:**

1. Equipment sensor data:
   - Vibration sensors (3-axis accelerometers at 1KHz)
   - Temperature readings (sampled every 30 seconds)
   - Power consumption (amperage, voltage, sampled every second)
   - Motor speed, torque, and load metrics
   - Acoustic sensors (microphones near critical components)

2. Operational data:
   - Throughput metrics (items processed per hour)
   - Equipment duty cycles and operating schedules
   - Environmental conditions (humidity, ambient temperature)
   - Operational mode changes (startup, shutdown, speed changes)

3. Maintenance records:
   - Historical maintenance logs and repair records
   - Component replacement history
   - Prior failure reports with root cause analysis
   - Technician notes and observations (unstructured text)

4. Equipment metadata:
   - Equipment specifications and expected operating parameters
   - Manufacturer recommended maintenance schedules
   - Equipment age, service history, and known issues
   - Component hierarchies and dependencies

**Data Collection Architecture:**
