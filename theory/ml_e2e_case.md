# Amazon ML Case Study: End-to-End Solution (Improved)

## Case Study: Anomaly Detection for Amazon Fulfillment Centers

This comprehensive case study demonstrates how to approach a complex ML system design problem from beginning to end, specifically for an Amazon L4 Applied Scientist interview.

### Problem Statement

Amazon operates hundreds of fulfillment centers worldwide, processing millions of orders daily. Each fulfillment center contains complex machinery such as conveyor systems, sorting equipment, and robotic picking systems. Equipment failures cause significant operational disruptions, leading to delayed shipments and increased costs.

Your task is to design an end-to-end anomaly detection system that can:
1. Identify potential equipment failures before they occur (Predictive Maintenance).
2. Prioritize maintenance activities to minimize disruption and optimize resource allocation.
3. Scale across hundreds of fulfillment centers globally.
4. Improve over time as more data is collected and feedback is incorporated.

### 1. Problem Analysis & Framing

**Business Impact Assessment:**
- Each hour of downtime costs approximately $50,000-100,000 per fulfillment center (FC).
- Scheduled maintenance is estimated to be ~70% less costly than emergency repairs (including downtime cost).
- Current reactive approach leads to an average of 3-4 major disruptions monthly per facility.
- Maintenance teams are limited resources; efficient allocation is crucial.
- Goal: Reduce unplanned downtime by X% (e.g., 30% in Year 1), reduce maintenance costs by Y% (e.g., 15% in Year 1).
- ROI calculation: For 100 FCs, reducing downtime by 2 hours per month could save $120-240M annually.

**ML Problem Formulation:**
- **Primary task:** Multi-variate time series anomaly detection. Detect deviations from normal operating behavior based on sensor data.
- **Secondary tasks:**
    - Anomaly severity classification (e.g., low, medium, high risk).
    - Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for critical components (regression task).
    - Failure mode classification (multi-class classification, requires labeled data).
- **Input data:** Sensor readings (time series), operational metrics, maintenance logs (structured and unstructured), equipment metadata.
- **Output:** Anomaly scores/flags, estimated failure probability/RUL, recommended maintenance actions and timing, severity level.

**Key Constraints & Considerations:**
- **Low false positive tolerance:** Alerting maintenance teams unnecessarily is costly and erodes trust. However, missing a true failure (false negative) is even more costly. Need to balance Precision and Recall based on business cost.
- **Latency:** Near-real-time detection needed (minutes, not hours) to allow for intervention.
- **Scalability:** Solution must scale to hundreds of FCs with potentially thousands of monitored assets each.
- **Heterogeneity:** Equipment varies across FCs (manufacturers, age, sensors, operating conditions). Models need to generalize or adapt.
- **Data Availability:** Limited labeled failure data (failures are rare events), but abundant normal operation data. Maintenance logs might be noisy or incomplete.
- **Environment:** Industrial environment (noisy sensors, potential connectivity issues).
- **Deployment:** Mix of edge computing capabilities (some FCs) and reliable cloud connectivity (all FCs).

**Assumptions Made:**
- Basic sensor infrastructure (or willingness to invest) exists or can be deployed.
- Network connectivity between edge gateways and AWS cloud is generally available, with mechanisms to handle temporary outages.
- Maintenance teams are willing to adopt and provide feedback on an ML-driven system.
- Sufficient computational resources (Edge/Cloud) can be provisioned.
- Data privacy/security protocols are adhered to for sensor and operational data.
- Executive stakeholders have approved the initial POC funding for a select number of FCs.
- Existing maintenance workflows can be integrated with or extended to include ML-driven alerts.

            # Extract and validate sensor readings
            for record in kinesis_stream:
                # Parse JSON payload
                payload = json.loads(record)
                equipment_id = payload.get('equipment_id')
                sensor_readings = payload.get('readings', {})
                
                # Apply filtering to remove noise (simple example)

                for sensor_id, values in sensor_readings.items():
                    # Apply Kalman filter or moving average
                    filtered_values = apply_filter(values)
                    # Check for invalid readings and apply bounds

                    filtered_readings[sensor_id] = filtered_values
                
                # Extract time-domain features
                time_features = extract_time_features(filtered_readings)

### 3. Model Development Approach

**Modeling Strategy:**

1.  **Hierarchical:**
    *   Component-level models (e.g., specific motor bearing).
    *   Equipment-level models (e.g., entire conveyor section).
    *   System-level models (interactions between equipment).
    *   Common patterns across similar equipment types in different FCs.

2.  **Multi-stage:**
    *   **Stage 1: Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised/Semi-supervised):** Identify *any* deviation from normal. Train primarily on normal data. High recall desired initially.
        *   Algorithms: Statistical methods (IQR, Z-score on features), Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders (LSTM-AE, TCN-AE), VAEs.
        *   Selection criteria: Start with simpler algorithms for interpretability, move to deep learning when necessary for complex patterns.
    *   **Stage 2: Anomaly Classification/Scoring (Supervised/Semi-supervised):** Classify detected anomalies by severity or potential failure mode. Requires some labeled data (historical failures, technician feedback).
        *   Algorithms: Use anomaly reconstruction error/score, train classifiers (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, simple NN) on features extracted around the anomaly window, potentially using labels from maintenance logs. Active learning to prioritize labeling.
        *   Leverage Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms (Random Cut Forest, XGBoost) and custom containers for specialized models.
    *   **Stage 3: RUL Prediction (Supervised):** Predict time-to-failure for specific components/modes. Requires run-to-failure data or degradation signals.
        *   Algorithms: Survival analysis models, LSTMs, Transformers trained on sequences leading up to known failures.
        *   Probabilistic outputs (distribution of failure times) rather than single-point estimates.

**Algorithms Selection Rationale:**

*   **Start Simple:** Begin with statistical methods and tree-based ensembles (Isolation Forest) for baselines – interpretable, fast.
    ```python
    # Example: Statistical anomaly detection baseline
    def statistical_baseline(time_series, window_size=20, threshold=3.0):
        """
        Simple rolling z-score anomaly detection
        
        Args:
            time_series: Array of sensor readings
            window_size: Size of rolling window
            threshold: Number of standard deviations to consider anomalous
            
        Returns:
            Array of anomaly scores (z-scores) and binary anomaly flags
        """
        # Calculate rolling mean and std
        rolling_mean = np.convolve(time_series, 
                                   np.ones(window_size)/window_size, 
                                   mode='valid')
        
        # Pad beginning values with first calculated value
        padding = np.repeat(rolling_mean[0], window_size-1)
        rolling_mean = np.concatenate([padding, rolling_mean])
        
        # Calculate rolling std with similar padding
        rolling_std = []
        for i in range(len(time_series) - window_size + 1):
            std = np.std(time_series[i:i+window_size])
            rolling_std.append(std)
        
        rolling_std = np.concatenate([
            np.repeat(rolling_std[0], window_size-1),
            np.array(rolling_std)
        ])
        
        # Handle division by zero
        rolling_std = np.where(rolling_std == 0, 0.0001, rolling_std)
        
        # Calculate z-scores
        z_scores = np.abs((time_series - rolling_mean) / rolling_std)
        
        # Generate anomaly flags
        anomalies = z_scores > threshold
        
        return z_scores, anomalies
    ```

*   **Deep Learning for Temporal Patterns:** Autoencoders (LSTM, TCN, Transformer variants) are powerful for learning complex temporal dependencies in multivariate sensor data without labels. Reconstruction error serves as anomaly score. VAEs provide probabilistic outputs.
*   **Handling Limited Labels:** Semi-supervised approaches (e.g., train AE on normal data, use reconstruction error), active learning (query technicians on uncertain anomalies), transfer learning (pre-train on similar equipment with more data).
*   **Federated Learning:** Consider for privacy or cross-facility learning without centralizing raw data (though likely less critical if data is centrally owned by Amazon).
*   **Algorithm Decision Framework:**

| Algorithm | Pros | Cons | Best Use Case | AWS Implementation |
|-----------|------|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Statistical Methods | Fast, interpretable, no training | Simplistic, struggles with multivariate | Initial baseline, simple sensors | Lambda functions |
| Isolation Forest | Handles high-dimensional data, fast | Less effective with temporal patterns | Quick deployment, limited data | SageMaker built-in |
| One-Class SVM | Effective for medium datasets | Slow on large datasets, parameter tuning | Well-defined normal behavior | SageMaker custom containers |
| LSTM Autoencoder | Captures temporal dependencies | Training time, black box | Complex time series, sufficient data | SageMaker PyTorch/TensorFlow |
| Random Cut Forest | Online learning, streaming-friendly | May miss subtle anomalies | Streaming data, continual updating | SageMaker built-in |

**Model Implementation Details (Conceptual):**

1.  **Anomaly Detection (Temporal Autoencoder Example):**
    ```python
    # Using TensorFlow/Keras
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, UpSampling1D, LSTM, RepeatVector, TimeDistributed, Dense
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
    import numpy as np

    def create_lstm_autoencoder(seq_length, n_features):
        inputs = Input(shape=(seq_length, n_features))
        # Encoder: Learn compressed representation
        encoded = LSTM(128, activation='relu', return_sequences=True)(inputs)
        encoded = LSTM(64, activation='relu', return_sequences=False)(encoded) # Bottleneck
        # Repeat vector to feed into decoder
        repeat_vec = RepeatVector(seq_length)(encoded)
        # Decoder: Reconstruct original sequence
        decoded = LSTM(64, activation='relu', return_sequences=True)(repeat_vec)
        decoded = LSTM(128, activation='relu', return_sequences=True)(decoded)
        outputs = TimeDistributed(Dense(n_features))(decoded) # Output layer matches input features

        model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # Mean Squared Error for reconstruction loss
        return model

    # Anomaly Scoring: High reconstruction error indicates anomaly
    def compute_anomaly_score(model, sequence):
        # sequence shape: (1, seq_length, n_features)
        reconstruction = model.predict(sequence)
        # Calculate feature-wise MSE
        mse_per_feature = np.mean(np.power(sequence - reconstruction, 2), axis=1)
        # Calculate overall MSE
        mse = np.mean(mse_per_feature, axis=1)
        return mse[0], mse_per_feature[0] # Return overall score and feature-wise scores
    ```
    *   *Choice Rationale:* LSTMs are suitable for capturing temporal dependencies. Autoencoders learn a compressed representation of "normal" behavior; deviations result in high reconstruction error (MSE). Feature-wise errors help with interpretability.

2.  **RUL Prediction (Multi-task Example):**
    ```python
    # Using TensorFlow/Keras
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Bidirectional, LSTM, Dense, Dropout
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

    def create_rul_predictor(seq_length, n_features, n_failure_modes):
        inputs = Input(shape=(seq_length, n_features))
        # Feature extraction using Conv1D
        x = Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=7, padding='same', activation='relu')(inputs)
        x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(x)
        x = Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=5, padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
        x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(x)
        # Temporal modeling using Bi-LSTM
        x = Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True))(x)
        x = Bidirectional(LSTM(32, return_sequences=False))(x) # Get final state
        # Dense layers for prediction heads
        x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
        x = Dropout(0.3)(x) # Dropout for regularization - prevents overfitting
        x = Dense(32, activation='relu')(x)

        # Output heads for multi-task learning
        rul_output = Dense(1, name='rul')(x) # Regression: Remaining Useful Life
        failure_prob = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='failure_prob')(x) # Binary Classification: High failure risk soon?
        failure_mode = Dense(n_failure_modes, activation='softmax', name='failure_mode')(x) # Multi-class Classification

        model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[rul_output, failure_prob, failure_mode])
        # Compile with different losses and weights per task
        model.compile(
            optimizer='adam',
            loss={'rul': 'mse', 'failure_prob': 'binary_crossentropy', 'failure_mode': 'categorical_crossentropy'},
            loss_weights={'rul': 1.0, 'failure_prob': 0.5, 'failure_mode': 0.3}, # Tune weights based on importance
            metrics={'rul': 'mae', 'failure_prob': 'accuracy', 'failure_mode': 'accuracy'}
        )
        return model
    ```
    *   *Choice Rationale:* CNN layers extract spatial features across sensors within a time step, Bi-LSTMs capture temporal patterns in both directions. Multi-task learning allows sharing representations, potentially improving performance on related tasks (RUL, failure probability, mode) especially with limited labels for some tasks. Dropout adds regularization to prevent overfitting.

**Training Methodology:**

1.  **Data Strategy:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Train primarily on data known to be normal (long periods without failures, outside maintenance windows). Use techniques like contamination training if some anomalies might be present.
    *   **Classification/RUL:** Use labeled historical data. Augment with synthetic data (e.g., SMOTE for classification, physics-based simulations, or generative models if feasible) due to imbalance. Use data from similar equipment via transfer learning.
    *   **Training/Validation/Test Split:** Use time-based splitting to prevent data leakage (future information shouldn't be used for predicting past events).

2.  **Evaluation Framework:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Precision, Recall, F1-score (tune threshold based on cost matrix), AUC-ROC, PR-AUC (better for imbalance). Time-based cross-validation (train on past, test on future) is crucial. Evaluate time-to-detection.
    *   **RUL:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), scoring functions considering early/late predictions (early prediction is better than late).
    *   **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision/Recall/F1 per class, Confusion Matrix, business impact metrics (cost of false positives vs. false negatives).
    *   **Business Metrics:** Cost savings from prevented downtime, reduction in emergency maintenance, maintenance staff efficiency.

3.  **Transfer Learning:** Pre-train models on data-rich equipment types or simulated data. Fine-tune on specific equipment/FCs with limited data. Use techniques like domain adaptation.
    ```python
    # Example of transfer learning approach (pseudo-code)
    # 1. Pre-train on source domain (data-rich equipment)
    source_model = train_autoencoder(source_data)
    
    # 2. Fine-tune on target domain (limited data equipment)
    # Initialize with source model weights
    target_model = create_autoencoder_with_same_architecture()
    target_model.set_weights(source_model.get_weights())
    
    # Fine-tune with target data (potentially freezing early layers)
    for layer in target_model.layers[:freeze_layer_index]:
        layer.trainable = False
    
    target_model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001),
                         loss='mse')
    target_model.fit(target_data, target_data, ...)
    ```

4.  **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Use SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning (Bayesian optimization) to find optimal parameters (learning rate, layer sizes, regularization, window sizes).
    ```python
    # Example SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning configuration
    hyperparameter_ranges = {
        "learning_rate": ContinuousParameter(0.0001, 0.1, scaling_type="logarithmic"),
        "batch_size": CategoricalParameter([32, 64, 128, 256]),
        "lstm_hidden_units": CategoricalParameter([32, 64, 128]),
        "dropout_rate": ContinuousParameter(0.1, 0.5),
        "window_size": CategoricalParameter([20, 50, 100, 200])
    }
    
    tuner = HyperparameterTuner(
        estimator=estimator,
        objective_metric_name="validation:loss",
        hyperparameter_ranges=hyperparameter_ranges,
        metric_definitions=[
            {"Name": "validation:loss", "Regex": "validation loss: ([0-9\\.]+)"}
